# Slave To The Algorithm : Week 1

### We made it! (sorta.. :)
This week's class was split between a wide-reaching 'overview' of the field of generative and parametric design, these specifics on the seminar, and the link to the seminar slides can also be found [almost verbatim] on Canvas.


### Resources available on Canvas
[Reading List](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/76067/pages/readings-references-resources) —lots of stuff I couldn't find in the Library or was not available in digital format
