# Slave-To-The-Algorithm
Studio-related & useful code
This Repository is for students and studio colleagues to find, store and share code for Slave To The Algorithm.

Look in each week's /code folder for snippets from the weekly workshops. Each week's 'readme' will have links to artists. Each week will be listed here as it gets activated.

## [First Things First](FAQ_start.md)

Please set up your own github repository to store your sketches/code and software. Each week you will make a new folder with (at least) a README.md with one or more screenshots of the work you have done in class + any completed homework tasks. You will also put your code from your homework in these folders—your homework should be your own original code. You will tell me your github address in class and you will add it to [this document](student_githubs.md) by making your very first pull request.
